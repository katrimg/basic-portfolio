    <div id="main-bio">
        <p>Hello my name is Katri Morrison-Goulias, and I’m originally from Santa Barbara, California. I love Arizona, because it’s always warm, and there are so many things to do and see. Some of my hobbies include boating on the lake, finding new places to brunch, and hiking. I also have a Sphynx cat named Buddha. </p>
    </div> 
    
    <div id="second-bio">
    <p>I graduate from Arizona State on May 9th with a BS in GIT from the IRA Fulton School of Engineering. I’m enrolled in this bootcamp to expand my technical skills, because my major focused on the design of websites rather than development. </p>
